    <h3> GOOD NEWS FOR SONIC FANS!!</h3>
    Remember when you used to watch Sonic X every Saturday morning at 9:00am? Well, after showing "Rebirth of the Planets,"
    4Kids canceled Sonic X for a year, but now, at 11:15am when I was just flipping through the channels, I stopped at channel 2 and found out,
    4Kids brought back Sonic X! So, starting today,s4Kids will show reruns, starting from episode 1, of Sonic X every Saturday at 11:00am!
    Oh, and if you're from Mexico, Feliz Cinco de Mayo!
